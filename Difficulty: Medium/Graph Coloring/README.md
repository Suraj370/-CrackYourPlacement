# Graph Coloring
Graph coloring refers to the problem of coloring vertices of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. This is also called the vertex coloring problem. If coloring is done using at most m colors, it is called m-coloring.



```
Input:     boolean[][] graph = {
            { false, true, true, true },
            { true, false, true, false },
            { true, true, false, true },
            { true, false, true, false }
        }

        // Number of colors
        int m = 3

Output:Solution Exists: Following are the assigned colors
 1  2  3  2
