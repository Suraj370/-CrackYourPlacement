# Minimum cost for acquiring all coins with k extra coins allowed with every coin

You are given a list of N coins of different denominations. You can pay an amount equivalent to any 1 coin and can acquire that coin. In addition, once you have paid for a coin, we can choose at most K more coins and can acquire those for free. The task is to find the minimum amount required to acquire all the N coins for a given value of K.

Examples:
```
Input : coin[] = {100, 20, 50, 10, 2, 5}, 
        k = 3
Output : 7

Input : coin[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50}, 
        k = 3
Output : 3
```
